^#5aa9d6;Adds new weapon type, quarterstaff.^reset;

The quarterstaff is nearly identical to the spear in usage except it does significantly less damage but has the added perks of a large amount of knockback and a quicker swing. Very useful for keeping enemies away from your face.

Currently only added to random generation, no crafting yet. (spawnitem commonqs etc...)

Art entirely from vanilla assets.
