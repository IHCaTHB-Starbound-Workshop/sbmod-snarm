^#5aa9d6;Adds incredibly short barrels to existing gun generation.^reset;

Does not add any new items. Chance to generate snub nose variant ~ 1/3.

Will not be compatible with any other mod that adds additional gun barrel variants, there are none that I could find, but if you experience a compatibility issue let me know and i'll produce a patch ASAP.
